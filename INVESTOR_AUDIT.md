### 1. Typography Overhaul

Implemented **Playfair Display** (Luxury Serif) for headings and **Manrope** (Modern Sans) for UI. This creates immediately perceptible value.

- **Men:** Midnight Slate (`#0F172A`) & Premium Teal (`#2DD4BF`).
- **Result:** Distinct, expensive-looking visual identities for each section.

### 3. Motion & Interactivity (Framer Motion)

- **Hover Physics:** Interactive cards that lift and glow (tactile feel).
- **Parallax:** Subtle image zooms to create depth.

### 4. "Telephone Friendly" Optimization

- **Sticky Bottom Bar:** A persistent "Call / Book" bar appears on mobile scroll.
- **Touch Targets:** Expanded tap areas in the mobile menu.
- **Glassmorphism:** Modern, translucent UI elements that feel native and high-tech.
